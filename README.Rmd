# crudr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `crudr` is to simplify a crud app that works with 
Shiny and DT, and that maintains a corresponding change-tracking 
table in the database.
Most of crudr is just one function: `cdr_manage_db_tbls()` 


## Try it out

`crudr` is still in development and not available from CRAN, but it works pretty 
well for the databases: sqlite, postgres, and snowflake. 
You can install the development version of crudr from Github by running:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("eauleaf/crudr")
```
