# crudr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `crudr` is to simplify a crud app that works with Shiny and
DT, and that maintains a corresponding change tracking table within in
the database. Most of crudr is just one function: `cdr_manage_db_tbls()`

## Try it out

`crudr` is still in development and not available from CRAN yet, but it
works pretty well for the databases: sqlite, postgres, and snowflake.
You can install the development version of crudr from Github by running:

``` r
remotes::install_github("eauleaf/crudr")
```
